Expired accounts prevent login but retain audit history.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Edit user settings → Account expiration\nProcedure\n\nLocate the user account.\nEdit the expiration date or remove it where appropriate.\nSave changes and confirm the account is active.\n\nExpiration dates should be applied deliberately and reviewed periodically.\n\n\n4.3.3 Suspending or reactivating a user account\nAccounts may be suspended due to staff changes, temporary inactivity, or security concerns.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Suspend user / Reactivate user\nProcedure\n\nChange the account status as required.\nConfirm the updated status has taken effect.\n\nSuspension is reversible and preserves audit history. It is preferred to deletion in most cases.\n\n\n4.3.4 Resending account creation emails\nUsers occasionally report not receiving their initial account creation email.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Resend account email\nProcedure\n\nConfirm the account exists and is active.\nVerify the email address.\nResend the account or password email.\nAsk the user to check spam or quarantine folders.\n\nRepeated failures usually indicate email filtering rather than a REDCap issue.\n\n\n4.3.5 Creating a new user account\nNew accounts are created centrally to ensure traceability and appropriate use.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Add New User\nProcedure\n\nEnter the user’s name, email address, and institutional affiliation.\nSet an expiration date if required.\nSave the account and confirm the email notification is sent.\n\nShared or generic accounts should not be created.\n\n\n4.3.6 Approving project creation\nRequests for new projects require administrative approval.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Project requests / Pending project requests → Review request\nProcedure\n\nReview the stated project purpose.\nConfirm whether surveys, public links, API access, or sensitive data are involved.\nApprove or reject the request accordingly.\n\nApproval implies that baseline governance expectations have been communicated.\n\n\n4.3.7 Moving a project to production\nProjects must be reviewed before moving from development to production.\nBreadcrumb (project initiates)\nProject → Setup → Move project to Production\nBreadcrumb (administrator approves)\nControl Center → Pending requests / Production move requests → Approve\nProcedure\n\nConfirm testing is complete.\nVerify that instruments and settings are stable.\nApprove the move and document the action if non-routine.\n\nProduction status has audit and governance implications and should not be reversed lightly.\n\n\n4.3.8 Approving API tokens\nAPI access enables automated data exchange and introduces additional risk.\nBreadcrumb (project initiates)\nProject → Applications → API → Request token\nBreadcrumb (administrator approves)\nControl Center → API token requests → Approve\nProcedure\n\nReview the justification for API access.\nConfirm the requester understands scope and security responsibilities.\nApprove the token if appropriate.\nEncourage least-privilege use and periodic review.\n\n\n\n4.3.9 Activating external modules\nExternal modules extend REDCap functionality but may affect system behaviour.\nBreadcrumb (system level)\nControl Center → External Modules → Manage modules\nBreadcrumb (project level)\nProject → External Modules → Enable module\nProcedure\n\nReview the purpose and documentation of the module.\nConfirm compatibility with the current REDCap version.\nAssess performance and security implications.\nEnable and monitor usage.\n\nNot all modules are appropriate for all installations.",
