    "text": "Introduction\nThis book is an operations and maintenance guide for the REDCap service available at The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill campus. In early 2026, the operations of this REDCap installation pass from the CaribData funded project to the Cave Hill campus. This book is provided to provide operational continuity.\nREDCap is at heart an online data collection platform. In practice though it is much more—it is an institutional service that supports research governance, ethics, data protection, and day-to-day academic work. When it runs quietly, nobody notices. When it fails, the consequences are immediate and visible. This guide documents how the service is actually run, with less information on how it is built and configured.\nSo the focus here is operational: routine tasks, decision points, risks, and recovery. The intent is not to explain how REDCap works for end users, nor to replicate official REDCap documentation. Instead, this guide captures the local knowledge required to keep the service stable, compliant, and trustworthy over time.",

They may have governance or data protection implications, and teh administrator must also ensure that each new project projects a minimum level of project-level metadata. This metadata is requested by the system when users are completing a new project request - however, some metadata fields are optional and free text. Administrator metadata review is necessary.\n\n\n4.3.3 Technical and system-related support\nA smaller number of requests involve more technical issues, such as:\n\nsurvey behaviour that appears inconsistent or broken;\nerrors triggered by server security rules;\nmobile app synchronisation issues;\nissues following REDCap version upgrades.\n\nWhere issues relate to infrastructure or server configuration, they are escalated to the hosting provider. The current server providers (HIPAA-Vault) have generally been highly responsive to our server-related questions.",

    "text": "4.4 Common administrative support procedures\nThis section documents the most frequent administrative actions carried out by REDCap administrators in response to user support requests.\nProcedures assume administrator-level access and familiarity with REDCap terminology. They focus on what to do and what to check, rather than user-interface walkthroughs that may change between REDCap versions.\n\n4.4.1 Resetting a user password\nPassword resets are required when users cannot log in or did not receive their original account email (occassionally, the automated REDCap email has been redirected by a user’s spam filter).\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Reset password / Send password reset email\nProcedure\n\nLocate the user account.\nConfirm the account is active and the email address is correct.\nTrigger a password reset or reset email.\nAdvise the user to check inbox and spam or quarantine folders.\n\nIf the user does not receive the email, verify outbound email configuration and consider institutional mail filtering.\n\n\n4.4.2 Extending or resetting a user account expiration date\nUser accounts may expire automatically based on institutional or administrative policy. Expired accounts prevent login but retain audit history.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Edit user settings → Account expiration\nProcedure\n\nLocate the user account.\nEdit the expiration date or remove it where appropriate.\nSave changes and confirm the account is active.\nAdvise the user of their updated account expiration\n\nExpiration dates should be applied deliberately and reviewed periodically.\n\n\n4.4.3 Suspending or reactivating a user account\nAccounts may be suspended due to staff changes, temporary inactivity, or security concerns.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Suspend user / Reactivate user\nProcedure\n\nChange the account status as required.\nConfirm the updated status has taken effect.\n\nSuspension is reversible and preserves audit history. It is preferred to deletion in most cases.\n\n\n4.4.4 Resending account creation emails\nUsers occasionally report not receiving their initial account creation email.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Resend account email\nProcedure\n\nConfirm the account exists and is active.\nVerify the email address.\nResend the account or password email.\nAsk the user to check spam or quarantine folders.\n\nRepeated failures have generally turned out to be email filtering rather than a REDCap issue.\n\n\n4.4.5 Creating a new user account\nNew accounts are created centrally to ensure traceability and appropriate use.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → Add New User\nProcedure\n\nEnter the user’s name, email address, and institutional affiliation.\nSet an expiration date if required.\nSave the account and confirm the email notification is sent.\n\nShared or generic accounts should not be created. Groups of new users can be created in a single proedure by using the Create Users (Bulk Upload) facility. This involves completing a REDCap Excel template and uploading that template.\n\n\n4.4.6 Approving project creation\nRequests for new projects require administrative approval.\nBreadcrumb\nControl Center → To-Do List → Pending requests → Review request\nProcedure\n\nReview the stated project purpose.\nConfirm whether surveys, public links, API access, or sensitive data are involved.\nApprove or reject the request accordingly.\n\nApproval implies that baseline governance expectations have been communicated.\n\n\n4.4.7 Moving a project to production\nProjects must be reviewed before moving from development to production. Best practice dictates that projects should only be moved to Production once the database has been designed and carefully tested. Reverting a project to Development after data-entry has started risks data loss.\nBreadcrumb (project initiates)\nProject → Setup → Move project to Production\nBreadcrumb (administrator approves)\nControl Center → To-Do List → Pending requests / Production move requests → Approve\nProcedure\n\nConfirm testing is complete.\nVerify that instruments and settings are stable.\nApprove the move and document the action if non-routine.\n\nProduction status has audit and governance implications and should not be reversed lightly.\n\n\n4.4.8 Approving API tokens\nAPI access enables automated data exchange and introduces additional risk.\nBreadcrumb (project initiates)\nProject → Applications → API → Request token\nBreadcrumb (administrator approves)\nControl Center → API token requests → Approve\nProcedure\n\nReview the justification for API access.\nConfirm the requester understands scope and security responsibilities.\nApprove the token if appropriate.\nEncourage least-privilege use and periodic review.\n\n\n\n4.4.9 Activating external modules\nExternal modules extend REDCap functionality but may affect system behaviour.\nBreadcrumb (system level)\nControl Center → External Modules → Manage modules\nBreadcrumb (project level)\nProject → External Modules → Enable module\nProcedure\n\nReview the purpose and documentation of the module.\nConfirm compatibility with the current REDCap version.\nAssess performance and security implications.\nEnable and monitor usage.\n\nNot all modules are appropriate for all installations.",

    "text": "3.2 Administrative role and scope\nREDCap administrators (who have the highest level of front-end access) are responsible for the configuration and oversight of the REDCap system itself. This role is distinct from that of project managers, who control activity within individual projects.\nAdministrative responsibilities include user account management, approval of projects and elevated functions, and oversight of the project lifecycle.\n\n3.2.1 User account management\nAll user accounts are created and managed centrally. Requests for access are submitted via the designated REDCap support email—currently: redcap@cavehill.uwi.edu and should clearly state:\n\nthe user’s affiliation,\nintended use of REDCap,\nwhether they are joining an existing project or proposing a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUser Sponsors\n\n\n\nIf a current project owner wants to add new system users, the email request should come from the project owner. That project owner would then be setup as a user sponsor and have access to a sponsor dashboard for automating certain user related activities.\n\n\nAdministrators are responsible for ensuring that:\n\naccounts are issued only to identifiable individuals;\naccounts use appropriate institutional or approved email addresses whenever possible;\naccess is removed or suspended promptly when affiliation ends;\naccount expiration dates are used in all cases.\n\nShared or generic accounts are not permitted, as they undermine auditability and accountability.\n\n\n3.2.2 Project creation and approval\nNew projects require administrative approval before they are created or activated. This step ensures that projects are correctly classified (for example, research versus operational use), certain additional project-level metadata are collected, and that basic governance expectations are understood by project owners.\nAdministrators should confirm that project owners/managers understand their responsibilities for user management, data handling, and compliance within their projects. This responsibility work has generally been performed as part of the onboarding process - whenever a new user is created or a new project created.\n\n\n3.2.3 Project lifecycle control\nAdministrators control key transitions in the project lifecycle, including:\n\napproval of project creation;\nmoving projects from development to production;\napproval of project copies;\narchiving of completed or inactive projects;\ndeletion of projects, where permitted by institutional policy.\n\nProject deletion is irreversible and should only occur after confirming data retention and governance requirements.",

Data collected in REDCap must only be used for the stated and approved purpose of the project and not for unrelated activities.\n\n\n8.8.2 Data minimisation\nOnly collect the minimum personal data necessary to achieve the project objectives. Avoid collecting identifiable information unless it is strictly required.\n\n\n8.8.3 Transparency and participant information\nWhere personal data are collected from individuals, participants must be provided with appropriate information about:\n\nwhat data are being collected;\nwhy the data are being collected;\nhow the data will be used;\nhow long the data will be retained;\nwho to contact regarding their data rights.\n\n\n\n8.8.4 Access control and user management\nAccess to the REDCap project must be limited to authorised users only. Users must be assigned the minimum role and permissions necessary to perform their duties. Project owners are responsible for:\n\napproving user access;\nremoving access when it is no longer required;\nensuring users do not share accounts or credentials.\n\n\n\n8.8.5 Data security\nREDCap must be used in accordance with institutional security guidance. Project owners must:\n\navoid exporting identifiable data unless necessary;\nstore exported data securely (think encryption);\nnever email unencrypted personal data;\nensure local copies of data are protected and access-controlled.\n\n\n\n8.8.6 Confidentiality and training\nAll project users must understand their duty of confidentiality. Users should have completed any required institutional data protection or research ethics training relevant to the project.\n\n\n8.8.7 Data quality and auditability\nProject owners are responsible for ensuring data are entered accurately and responsibly. REDCap audit logs must not be disabled or circumvented. Any data corrections must follow transparent and documented procedures.\n\n\n8.8.8 Data retention and deletion\nPersonal data must not be retained longer than necessary. Project owners must have a plan for:\n\ndata archiving;\nanonymisation or pseudonymisation where appropriate;\nsecure deletion when the retention period ends.\n\n\n\n8.8.9 Data subject rights\nProjects must be capable of supporting data subject rights under GDPR (or the local Data Protection Legislation of their home country), including:\n\naccess to personal data;\nrectification of inaccurate data;\nrestriction or objection where applicable;\nerasure, where legally permitted.\n\nProject owners must know how to escalate such requests through institutional channels.\n\n\n8.8.10 Incident reporting\nAny suspected data breach, loss, or unauthorised access must be reported immediately in accordance with institutional incident response procedures.",
