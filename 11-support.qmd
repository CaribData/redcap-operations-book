## Introduction 

This section describes how support for the UWI REDCap service is provided, including how requests are handled, triaged, and escalated.

The support model reflects the boundaries between REDCap software ownership (Vanderbilt University), local service operation (UWI and CaribData), and infrastructure hosting (HIPAA Vault).

## Purpose of local support

Local REDCap administrative support exists to enable effective and appropriate use of the platform. It focuses on helping users apply REDCap functionality correctly rather than providing research design, statistical, or methodological advice.

Support activities complement---they do not replace---the extensive documentation and training materials provided by Vanderbilt University.

### Example Vanderbilt Training Videos
Vanderbilt University offer a large range of training videos---many offered within the REDCap software---for REDCap users. As an example, here is a curated list of [training videos](./assets/training-videos-v1.pdf).

## Types of support requests

Support requests generally fall into three broad categories.

### Account and access support

These requests relate to user authentication and access, including:

- password resets;
- account expiration or reactivation;
- account suspension or deletion;
- account creation and affiliation changes.

These are the most common requests and are generally resolved through the REDCap Control Center.

### Project and permissions support

These requests relate to project-level governance and configuration, including:

- approval of new projects;
- moving projects from development to production;
- approving project copies or deletions;
- managing user permissions and roles;
- approving API access or external modules.

These requests require more judgement. They may have governance or data protection implications, and teh administrator must also ensure that each new project projects a minimum level of project-level metadata. This metadata is requested by the system when users are completing a new project request - however, some metadata fields are optional and free text. Administrator metadata review is necessary.  

### Technical and system-related support

A smaller number of requests involve more technical issues, such as:

- survey behaviour that appears inconsistent or broken;
- errors triggered by server security rules;
- mobile app synchronisation issues;
- issues following REDCap version upgrades.

Where issues relate to infrastructure or server configuration, they are escalated to the hosting provider. The current server providers (HIPAA-Vault) have generally been highly responsive to our server-related questions. 

## Common administrative support procedures

This section documents the most frequent administrative actions carried out by REDCap administrators in response to user support requests.

Procedures assume administrator-level access and familiarity with REDCap terminology. They focus on what to do and what to check, rather than user-interface walkthroughs that may change between REDCap versions.

### Resetting a user password

Password resets are required when users cannot log in or did not receive their original account email (occassionally, the automated REDCap email has been redirected by a user's spam filter).

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Reset password / Send password reset email`

**Procedure**

1. Locate the user account.
2. Confirm the account is active and the email address is correct.
3. Trigger a password reset or reset email.
4. Advise the user to check inbox and spam or quarantine folders.

If the user does not receive the email, verify outbound email configuration and consider institutional mail filtering.

### Extending or resetting a user account expiration date

User accounts may expire automatically based on institutional or administrative policy. Expired accounts prevent login but retain audit history.

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Edit user settings → Account expiration`

**Procedure**

1. Locate the user account.
2. Edit the expiration date or remove it where appropriate.
3. Save changes and confirm the account is active.
4. Advise the user of their updated account expiration

Expiration dates should be applied deliberately and reviewed periodically.

### Suspending or reactivating a user account

Accounts may be suspended due to staff changes, temporary inactivity, or security concerns.

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Suspend user / Reactivate user`

**Procedure**

1. Change the account status as required.
2. Confirm the updated status has taken effect.

Suspension is reversible and preserves audit history. It is preferred to deletion in most cases.

### Resending account creation emails

Users occasionally report not receiving their initial account creation email.

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → Browse Users → (select user) → Resend account email`

**Procedure**

1. Confirm the account exists and is active.
2. Verify the email address.
3. Resend the account or password email.
4. Ask the user to check spam or quarantine folders.

Repeated failures have generally turned out to be email filtering rather than a REDCap issue.

### Creating a new user account

New accounts are created centrally to ensure traceability and appropriate use.

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → Add New User`

**Procedure**

1. Enter the user’s name, email address, and institutional affiliation.
2. Set an expiration date if required.
3. Save the account and confirm the email notification is sent.

Shared or generic accounts should not be created. Groups of new users can be created in a single proedure by using the `Create Users (Bulk Upload)` facility. This involves completing a REDCap Excel template and uploading that template.

### Approving project creation

Requests for new projects require administrative approval.

**Breadcrumb**  
`Control Center → To-Do List → Pending requests → Review request`

**Procedure**

1. Review the stated project purpose.
2. Confirm whether surveys, public links, API access, or sensitive data are involved.
3. Approve or reject the request accordingly.

Approval implies that [baseline governance expectations](./30-security.qmd) have been communicated.

### Moving a project to production

Projects must be reviewed before moving from development to production. Best practice dictates that projects should only be moved to Production once the database has been designed and carefully tested. Reverting a project to Development after data-entry has started risks data loss.

**Breadcrumb (project initiates)**  
`Project → Setup → Move project to Production`

**Breadcrumb (administrator approves)**  
`Control Center → To-Do List → Pending requests / Production move requests → Approve`

**Procedure**

1. Confirm testing is complete.
2. Verify that instruments and settings are stable.
3. Approve the move and document the action if non-routine.

Production status has audit and governance implications and should not be reversed lightly.

### Approving API tokens

API access enables automated data exchange and introduces additional risk.

**Breadcrumb (project initiates)**  
`Project → Applications → API → Request token`

**Breadcrumb (administrator approves)**  
`Control Center → API token requests → Approve`

**Procedure**

1. Review the justification for API access.
2. Confirm the requester understands scope and security responsibilities.
3. Approve the token if appropriate.
4. Encourage least-privilege use and periodic review.

### Activating external modules

External modules extend REDCap functionality but may affect system behaviour.

**Breadcrumb (system level)**  
`Control Center → External Modules → Manage modules`

**Breadcrumb (project level)**  
`Project → External Modules → Enable module`

**Procedure**

1. Review the purpose and documentation of the module.
2. Confirm compatibility with the current REDCap version.
3. Assess performance and security implications.
4. Enable and monitor usage.

Not all modules are appropriate for all installations.

## The REDCap Control Center: administrator orientation

The REDCap Control Center is the primary workspace for system administrators. It provides access to system-wide settings, approvals, and oversight tools.

Administrators should understand the structure of the Control Center rather than memorising individual menu items.

### Core administrative areas

- **User management**  
  `Control Center → Browse Users`  
  `Control Center → Add New User`

- **Project governance and approvals**  
  `Control Center → To-Do List → Pending requests`

- **System configuration**  
  `Control Center → System Configuration → General Configuration`

- **System-level User Settings**  
  `Control Center → System Configuration → User Settings`

- **External modules**  
  `Control Center → External Modules`

- **User Activity Logs**  
  `Control Center → Dashboards & Activity → User Activity Log`

### Administrative mindset

The Control Center is intentionally powerful. Most changes made here affect all users and projects.

Administrators should act conservatively, document non-routine actions, and favour reversible changes wherever possible.
