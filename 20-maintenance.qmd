This section describes how routine maintenance and upgrades are managed for the UWI REDCap service.

The REDCap application runs on a dedicated Linux virtual machine hosted by HIPAA Vault. This is a fixed-capacity, managed environment. Maintenance activities therefore require coordination between REDCap administrators and the hosting provider and should follow predictable, documented procedures.

## Responsibility boundaries

System maintenance spans multiple layers, each with a different owner.

HIPAA Vault is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, including server hardware, operating system patching, firewall management, and network security.

UWI, through its REDCap administrators, is responsible for the REDCap application itself, including configuration, upgrades, testing, and user communication.

Vanderbilt University provides the REDCap software and documentation but does not perform upgrades, host the system, or provide operational support.

Understanding these boundaries is essential when planning or responding to maintenance activities.

## Routine system checks

Administrators should perform periodic checks to confirm that REDCap is functioning as expected. These checks are typically lightweight and include verifying user access, confirming that surveys and alerts are running, and reviewing system messages or logs for warnings.

Routine checks help detect emerging issues early, particularly in a fixed-resource environment where gradual changes in usage can affect performance.

## REDCap version upgrades

REDCap releases frequent updates, including feature enhancements, bug fixes, and occasional security patches. UWI policy is to keep the system reasonably up to date while avoiding unnecessary disruption to users.

Upgrades should be informed by Vanderbilt release notes and changelogs. Not all releases require immediate action, but security-related updates should be prioritised.

## Pre-upgrade preparation

Before any upgrade, administrators should coordinate with HIPAA Vault to ensure a recent server snapshot is available. This provides a rollback option if the upgrade fails or introduces unexpected behaviour.

Where possible, new REDCap versions should be tested on a development or staging environment before being applied to the production system. Testing should focus on core functionality, authentication, surveys, alerts, and any enabled external modules.

Administrators should also notify users in advance if an upgrade is expected to cause service interruption.

## Performing upgrades

REDCap upgrades are typically applied by administrators with appropriate access to the server environment. In some cases, HIPAA Vault may assist with server-level changes required to support the upgrade, such as PHP or database adjustments.

Upgrades should be scheduled during periods of low usage where possible and should be followed immediately by basic functional checks.

## Post-upgrade validation

After an upgrade, administrators should confirm that:

- users can log in normally;
- projects open and behave as expected;
- surveys and alerts function correctly;
- no unexpected errors appear in logs or system messages.

Any issues should be investigated promptly. If necessary, administrators may revert to the pre-upgrade snapshot in coordination with HIPAA Vault.

## Unplanned maintenance and incidents

Occasionally, unplanned maintenance may be required in response to security vulnerabilities, system instability, or hosting issues.

In such cases, the priority is service stability and data protection. Administrators should document the issue, actions taken, and outcomes, and communicate clearly with users if service availability is affected.
