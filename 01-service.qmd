## Introduction 

This document describes the REDCap service operated for The University of the West Indies (UWI), Cave Hill, and the institutional responsibilities associated with its operation.

REDCap is a secure, web-based data capture platform developed and licensed by Vanderbilt University under a non-profit end-user licence agreement. UWI participates in the REDCap Consortium and operates REDCap in accordance with [Vanderbilt’s licensing terms](https://projectredcap.org/join/termsofuse/), governance expectations, and community standards.

The UWI REDCap instance has been project-managed by the [CaribData project](docs.caribdata.org) and hosted on dedicated infrastructure provided by [HIPAA-Vault](hipaavault.com) .

## What the service provides

The service enables UWI researchers and operational teams to:

- build and manage electronic data collection instruments;
- deploy surveys and forms for online and offline data capture;
- manage role-based access to projects and data;
- maintain full audit trails of data entry, modification, and export;
- export data to standard statistical packages;
- support longitudinal, survey-based, and operational projects.

These capabilities align with Vanderbilt’s definition of REDCap as a metadata-driven platform designed to support secure research and operational data workflows at scale.

**Crucially for researchers, this instance of REDCap is hosted on a GDPR-compliant server environment.**

## Hosting and infrastructure responsibilities

The REDCap application is hosted on dedicated servers managed by HIPAA-Vault under a commercial [hosting and support agreement](./assets/HIPAAVault-Sales-Agreement.pdf) with UWI. Under this arrangement, HIPAA-Vault is responsible for:

- server provisioning and maintenance;
- operating system patching and upgrades;
- managed firewalls and network security;
- infrastructure-level monitoring and incident response;
- data centre security and availability guarantees.

HIPAA-Vault provides infrastructure services only. Responsibility for REDCap configuration, user management, governance, and compliance remains with UWI and its designated administrators.

## Licensing and support boundaries

Vanderbilt University licenses REDCap software to UWI but does not provide hosting, operational support, or system administration services. Participation in the REDCap Consortium grants access to:

- the REDCap software;
- documentation and community resources;
- training materials and videos;
- peer support via the REDCap community.

Any new UWI REDCap administrator should apply to Vanderbilt University to join the REDCap [Community Site](https://projectredcap.org/resources/community/).

All operational responsibility for this instance lies with UWI and its service partners. This distinction is critical when planning support, staffing, and continuity arrangements.

## Service ownership

The REDCap service should be treated as an institutional digital service rather than a project-specific tool. This implies clear ownership for:

- policy and governance;
- funding and contracts;
- continuity planning;
- compliance with data protection and research ethics requirements.

Day-to-day administration and user support are delegated functions within this broader ownership framework.
