This section describes how backups and data recovery are handled for the UWI REDCap service.

Backups are a shared responsibility across infrastructure, application, and project levels. No single mechanism provides complete protection against data loss, and it is important to understand what each layer does — and does not — provide.

## Infrastructure-level backups

HIPAA Vault provides infrastructure-level backups and snapshots as part of its hosting service. These backups are designed to support disaster recovery in the event of server failure, corruption, or major incidents.

Infrastructure backups typically capture the state of the server at a point in time. They are not intended for routine data retrieval or fine-grained restoration of individual records or projects.

Retention periods and recovery windows are finite and governed by the hosting agreement. In the event of contract termination or prolonged service disruption, data availability is time-limited.

## Application-level safeguards in REDCap

REDCap includes built-in safeguards that support data integrity, including audit logs, change tracking, and controlled data exports.

These features support transparency and traceability but do not replace backups. They are most useful for understanding what changed and when, rather than for restoring lost data.

## Project-level data exports

Project teams are responsible for exporting and retaining copies of their own data in accordance with institutional policies and research governance requirements.

Regular data exports are the most reliable way for projects to ensure continuity, particularly for long-running studies or operational systems. Exports should be stored securely outside the REDCap environment.

Administrators should remind project owners that REDCap is a live system, not a long-term archival solution.

## Recovery scenarios

Different types of data loss require different responses.

In the case of accidental record deletion or user error, recovery may not be possible unless the project team has retained recent exports.

In the case of system-level failure, administrators may work with HIPAA Vault to restore the server from a recent snapshot. This process restores the system to a previous state and may result in loss of recent changes.

Clear communication with affected users is essential in all recovery scenarios.

## Testing and assurance

While full restoration tests are rare, administrators should periodically review backup arrangements with the hosting provider and confirm that snapshots are being taken as expected.

Understanding backup scope and limitations is a key part of service continuity planning.

## End-of-service considerations

If the REDCap service is migrated, decommissioned, or transferred to another institutional owner, data retrieval timelines become critical.

Project teams should be given clear notice and sufficient time to export their data. After hosting services are terminated, unretrieved data may become permanently inaccessible.
