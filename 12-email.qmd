## Introduction 

Email is a fundamental dependency for REDCap, enabling user notifications, survey distribution, and automated alerts. At the same time, it presents governance and security risks that require careful management.

This section documents how email is used within the UWI REDCap service and the principles governing its configuration.

## Role of email in REDCap

REDCap uses email to support core functions such as account creation, password management, survey invitations, reminders, and Alerts & Notifications configured within projects.

While email delivery is essential for normal operation, REDCap does not require a fixed or branded sender address, provided that outbound email routing is correctly configured.

## Universal FROM address considerations

A universal FROM address can provide consistency and simplify mail routing, but it also introduces a dependency on the continued availability of the associated domain and mailbox.

Where a universal FROM address is used, it should be institutionally owned, monitored, and reviewed periodically. Personal or externally funded mailboxes should be avoided.

Changes to the FROM address or SMTP configuration should be treated as service-level changes and tested accordingly.

The REDCap universal email address is: [redcap@cavehill.uwi.edu](mailto:redcap@cavehill.uwi.edu).

## Governance and risk management

Email should always be treated as an insecure communication channel. As such, sensitive personal or health data **must never be included** in email bodies or attachments.

Project-level alerts and survey invitations should reference records using identifiers rather than names, and project teams should be reminded of these constraints during project approval.

These practices align with both Vanderbilt guidance and the security assumptions of the hosting environment.

## Testing and change management

Any change to email configuration should be followed by systematic testing, including account notifications, survey invitations, and alerts from a test project. It is highly recommended that these changes be tested on the *development server* before making the change on the *production server*. 

Email issues are often invisible until users report failures, so short-term monitoring after changes is essential to ensure continuity of service.
